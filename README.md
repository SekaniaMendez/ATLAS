# ATLAS

ATLAS is a high-performance, cross-platform LiDAR mapping and SLAM engine,
designed for real-time perception and large-scale 3D reconstruction.

The project is developed as a solo engineering effort, with a strong focus on:
- Performance and scalability
- Clean, modular architecture
- Cross-platform support (macOS / Windows / Linux)
- ROS-independent design

## Status
🚧 Early development – core architecture and tooling in progress.

## Planned Features
- Custom LiDAR drivers (Livox Mid-360)
- Real-time point cloud processing
- Modular SLAM pipeline
- Optional AI-based point cloud understanding

## Tech Stack
- C++20
- CMake + Ninja
- OpenGL / ImGui (development UI)
